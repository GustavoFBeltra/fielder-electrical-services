What Our Customers Are Saying
Fielder did our electrical work in our 100 year old Webster Groves home.

They were friendly, efficient, the service was good, and in multiple jobs I’ve had done, I always found the price very reasonable. – Susan B.

i’ve been struggling with some inadequate wiring in my garage for over 20 years. Fielder Electric came out installed a new switch on the inside wall of the garage versus the old switch located in the kitchen. Many, many times the garage lights were left on since we could not see from inside the house that the lights were on. Everytime I turn the garage lights on…and off, i kick myself for not doing it years earlier. They also added several shop lights in the ceiling of the garage which involved new wiring as well as re-configuration of existing lighting. My daughter has used Fielder Electric to remove some old knob and tube wiring and replace with new wiring. They did a superb job there as well. Mr. Fielder was personally involved in estimating the cost of the job and sharing his insight and recommendations. Very nice, very articulate.er Groves home. – Dennis L.

I have been very pleased with the service I received from Fielder Electric. The work was completed on time and with excellent craftsmanship.
I will definitely be calling you for my next electrical project! Thank you – Ben Z.

Matt is a pro and very knowledgeable with some great suggestions. He promised and delivered on time – Christy B.

Kitchens
The Integrated Kitchen
The kitchen is commonly the central hub for gathering in the home. The busy nature of contemporary life demands that it serve as a living space as well as a place of meal preparation. The functional kitchen of today has a designated cooking space integrated with casual dining and is often open to adjacent rooms. Below are a few examples of integrated kitchens that we have wired. As you can see, the cooking area is open to dining areas and can include entertainment features, such as a television.




The Updated Kitchen
Realtors will tell you an updated kitchen is a major selling point of a home. Factors such as  size, location, and functionality impact a home’s resale value. The National Association of Realtors demonstrates that the top home improvement project resulting in a significant return on investment is a kitchen remodel.




Kitchen Appliances
Approximately 80% of kitchen upgrades feature new appliances, according to Houzz. The most frequently added appliances are dishwashers and microwaves, both of which require their own dedicated electrical circuits. We have also wired new separate cooktops, secondary ovens, wine chillers, ice makers, and more. Depending on the needs of your household, the addition of new circuits to operate these appliances may require an electrical service upgrade. In the images below, you can see some of the appliances we have added to update existing kitchens.




Kitchen Lighting
Lighting is an integral part of all kitchens. The same report that determined new appliances are very common in kitchen upgrades or remodels noted similar trends for lighting. More than 50% of all renovations in this room include three different types of lighting:

Ambient lighting: Examples include recessed lights, chandeliers, or track lighting.
Task lighting: Pendant lights or mounted under cabinet lights are ideal for food prep areas.
Accent lighting: The same lights we use for under cabinets can be used inside cabinets to add visual interest.

Under Cabinet Lighting
LED lighting is the energy efficient way to  illuminate any room.
LED (light emitting diode) bulbs are quickly gaining favor in residential lighting design because of their many benefits. With increasing frequency and as their popularity grows, we are installing LED devices in overhead and large lighting areas. That’s not all… their benefits extend to smaller, more localized areas, too. Whether it is in a kitchen, office, or entertainment area, our skilled electricians can install LED under cabinet lighting to enhance any room in your home.




LEDs provide directional light, resulting in a more focused beam of light, ideal for illuminating countertops and cabinets.
LEDs produce very little heat, keeping food stored on counters fresher longer. It also means your LED under cabinet lighting can be left on for extended periods of time without worry of overheating or fire.
These bulbs do not emit ultraviolet rays, which decrease nutrient levels in fruits and vegetables. So not only will countertop foods not be subjected to heat, they will also maintain their nutrient levels when using LED under cabinet lighting.
The LED strip lights we install are fully dimmable and available in multiple brightness levels.
LED lights can switched off and on frequently and without affecting the life or light strength of the bulbs.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the usable life span of LED bulbs is 25 times the life of a standard bulb.
Mounting above and near the sink is no issue- the LED strip lighting we use is rated to be used in damp locations.

EV Home Charging Stations
Charging Station
The home charging station is technically known as the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). However, is it commonly known as the charging station, or simply, the charger. There are three levels of EV charging (Level 1—the slowest, Level 2, and Level 3—the fastest). Home charging stations only consist of Level 1 and 2 varying depending on which charging level (voltage and amperage), cord length, and smart/WiFi capabilities.

Permits
For most home charging station installations, a permit is required by the local jurisdiction. These permits ensure the electrical code is being followed for you and your homes safety. Since it is highly recommended EV drivers install a Level 2 charger rather than a Level 1 (120 Volt), a permit is required for this higher voltage electrical work. 

Another cost to consider for installing a home charging station are the electrical materials. If you do not have a spare 240V outlet near your garage, a new circuit will need to be installed by an electrician. An electrical circuit consists primarily of the outlet, the wire, and the breaker. Altogether, these components safely allow for power to flow from your wall through your charger to your EV.

You love driving your electric vehicle, but probably do not like having to search for or wait at a public charging station. You’ve probably want to install an EV charging station at home but aren’t completely sure what all the benefits would be. For a homeowner or a multifamily resident, the value of an EV charging station installation and having the freedom to charge at home increases daily!



Here are five good reasons to install a Level 2 charging station at your home or rental property:
1. More convenient
An estimated 80% of EV drivers reportedly charge their vehicle at home, usually overnight. Those who install an EV charging station at home get in the habit of plugging the car in to charge at night, much like plugging in their cell phone. You won’t need the car (or phone) while sleeping, so you take advantage of the downtime and know you will be fully ready to go in the morning. Additionally, opting to install an EV charging station at home saves you the time involved in traveling to a public charger and waiting — sometimes for hours — while the EV acquires enough range for your needs.

2. Less expensive
Driving an EV was already cheaper per mile than running on gas when gas prices averaged $3.50 a gallon. However, to keep costs down, most people install an EV charging station at home and use it overnight, when electricity costs are lower. Conversely, those using public charging stations are typically using more expensive electricity during the day.

Besides recouping the cost of the electricity, public charging station owners, like all businesses, factor their overhead into their prices. These costs include rent or mortgage payments, the cost of the charging stations, maintenance, and profits. Even free public charging stations at malls, restaurants and other sites cost in terms of time and the fact that you will likely spend money while inside.

Sites with Level 3 DC fast-charging stations charge premium rates for their use. This is partly cost-based since those chargers cost significantly more than Level 2 chargers. A Level 3 EV charging station installation often requires property upgrades to facilitate their 400-V to 900-V direct current connections. Additionally, you are paying a premium rate for the ability to charge your car in about 30 minutes. Level 3 charging costs approximately 25% to 40% more than Level 2 charging.

3. More predictable
You don’t have to worry about waiting in line or getting stuck while charging at nearby public charging stations if you install an EV charger at home. Plug your EV in at your convenience, and program it to charge while you sleep, with the comfort of knowing you will have considerable range in the morning. Your EV undoubtedly came with a Level 1 charger that can be plugged into any 120-volt standard household outlet the charger’s cord reaches. While this charger will not fill most batteries even when plugged in all night, a Level 1 charger will add about 5 miles per hour, which may be adequate for your commute. Better still, if you had a more powerful Level 2 charging station installed at home, plugging in overnight can give you a range of about 250 miles, depending on the battery.

Regular pricing is another element of predictability that home charging offers. Unlike gas prices, which can fluctuate wildly during a year, electricity rates do not change often. You can figure out the rate your utility charges at a particular time of day and calculate your cost per fill-up. Public charging stations are still too new to gauge whether their pricing will be steady or increase for peak times, such as holiday weekends.

4. Better for your battery
EV automakers recommend limiting how often you use a Level 3 fast charger. Studies have found that frequent supercharging can degrade an EV battery faster than lower-level chargers. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take advantage when finding a vacant fast charger on a road trip so you can return to the highway faster, but using a Level 3 fast charger has been shown to affect the battery life negatively. Tesla has even programmed its cars to limit charging speeds if they are supercharged too often.

Additionally, it helps if you use a DC fast charger to fill the battery range only to 80%. Fast chargers charge quickly only when your battery’s state of charge (SOC) is below 80%. For the remaining 20%, these units slow down to avoid overcharging. You would be paying for a Level 3 charge at that point, but getting a lower level. It can take almost as long to add the remaining 20% of the amount as it did to reach the 80% level.

It is essential to know your battery type and what is most efficient and effective to extend its life. Not every EV battery can accommodate Level 3 charging.

5. Attracts tenants and increases property value
For property owners, making EV charging stations available is a way to differentiate your building and attract tenants. With most charging at home and many car manufacturers planning to phase out gas-powered cars, those living in multifamily buildings will soon demand an EV charging station installation or move elsewhere. The demand for electric vehicles will escalate considerably in the next year or two.

Real estate giant CBRE noted that it believes EV charging stations will eventually be an expected workplace amenity, like high-speed internet. The same will be true of multifamily properties. Renters, particularly those in more upscale areas and likely to buy new cars, will expect the ability to charge an EV at their complex soon if they do not already. Landlords should take advantage of the opportunity to show they are keeping their properties current to satisfy tenants looking to install an EV charging station at home despite living in an apartment. Besides being more attractive to potential renters, a building with charging infrastructure is likely to be more valuable.

Another reason property owners should act quickly is the availability of tax incentives in many states and cities. The federal government is funding state incentives for EV purchases and EV charging station installations. Incentives vary by jurisdiction and even utility served, but the benefits are considerable. For example, Illinois is introducing incentives that recoup 80% of costs for an EV charging station installation starting in July 2022. Connecticut also has a program offering money for Level 2 and Level 3 EV charging station installations.

Taking action today
The EV boom is here. You are probably noticing more and more EVs on the roads. If you do not have one yet, you may have begun to think about buying one. With so many new models hitting showrooms, deciding on which EV to get may be difficult.

Regardless of which EV you drive, getting an EV charger installed at your home or building allows you to take full advantage of the joy of not stopping for gas or a battery boost.

Knob and Tube


Knob and Tube Wiring
This method was an early standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings common in North America from about 1880 up until the 1970s. The system is considered obsolete and can be an electrical safety hazard, although some of the fear associated with it is undeserved. Below is some important information every home owner should know about Knob and Tube Wiring.

How Knob and Tube Wiring Works
Knob and Tube wiring consists of insulated copper conductors passing through lumber framing drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes. They are supported along their length by nailed-down porcelain knobs. Where wires enter a wiring device, such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they are protected by flexible cloth or rubber insulation called “loom.”

It is not inherently dangerous. The dangers from this system arise from its age, improper modifications to the electrical systems, and situations where building insulation envelops the wires.
It has no ground wire and thus cannot service any three-pronged appliances.
While it is considered obsolete, there is no code that requires its complete removal.It has no ground wire and thus cannot service any three-pronged appliances.
Advantages of Knob and Tube Wiring
It is treated differently in different jurisdictions. In some areas, it must be removed at all accessible locations, while others merely require that it not be installed in new construction.
It is not permitted in any electrical upgrades.
Knob and Tube wiring has a higher ampacity than wiring electrical systems of the same gauge. The reason for this is that the hot and neutral wires are separated from one another, usually by 4 to 6 inches, which allows the wires to readily dissipate heat into free air.
Knob and Tube wires are less likely than Romex cables to be punctured by nails because Knob and Tube wires are held away from the framing.
The porcelain components have an almost unlimited lifespan.
Knob and Tube wires are less likely than Romex cables to be punctured by nails.
Knob and Tube wiring installation requires more skill to install than Romex and, for this reason, unskilled people rarely ever installed it.

Aluminum Wiring Repairs

Homes with Aluminum wiring are 55 times more likely to have connections reach “Fire-Hazard-Conditions”
Aluminum wiring is commonly found in homes and additions built between 1965 and the mid-1970’s. During that time, the cost of copper increased, so aluminum was substituted in branch electrical circuits, such as outlets and switches. The only way for a home owner to tell if they have this wiring is to look at the printed outer jacket of electric cables, which are typically only visible in unfinished areas such as basements. Cable with aluminum conductors will be marked with “Al” or similar labels. If you have questions, call us!

Aluminum Wiring Facts
Aluminum wiring expands as it warms up and contracts when it cools down. This causes a loss in tightness at the connection.
According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, problems resulting from expansion can cause overheating at connections between the wiring and devices, or at splices.
An excess of two million homes in the United States were constructed using this type of wiring.
A qualified electrician (like those at Fielder Electrical Services) can replace or repair aluminum wiring to effectively and permanently reduce the possibility of fire and injury resulting from overheating connections.
How Fielder Electrical Services Handles Aluminum Wiring
If you see indications of issues with aluminum wiring, contact the qualified electricians at Fielder Electrical Services to make the devices in your home safe.

The most popular option for solving issues with aluminum wiring is to hire a licensed electrician to replace the connections at each outlet, switch, and junction box.

If you believe you have aluminum wiring in your home, contact our office at (314) 773-4955. Our licensed electricians have the expertise necessary to make your home wiring safe!

Fielder Electrical Services can wire all your outdoor lighting needs. From simple motion-activated spotlights to elaborate lighting design, we can help create the outdoor oasis of your dreams.


Outdoor lighting can be a huge asset to any home or business. The electricians of Fielder Electrical Services can do it all- from the simple light to more complex lighting designs. Whether you want to illuminate your outside oasis or provide convenience lighting in your most travelled pathways, we can wire that!

Security Lighting and Camera Installation Wiring
A well-lit home or business is a deterrent for unwelcome visitors. Because of this, outdoor lighting and cameras (cameras provided and programmed by customer) can add a measure of security while being functionally convenient. Security lights can be controlled by a switch, timer, motion sensor, or photo sensor (for dusk-to-dawn use). They are  most commonly located near entrances or parking areas.



Landscape Lighting
Landscape lights can serve several purposes. They can highlight architectural plants and trees. They also maintain an even & subtle ambient light in the area surrounding the fixture. Uplighting, downlighting- we do it all!




Post Lighting
Post lights can be added to many locations on the exterior of your home. They can be used as localized lighting to illuminate pathways and driveways. In addition, post lights can be added to your backyard or garden areas to eliminate dark corners.



Accent Lighting
Accent lighting can be incorporated to highlight important features of your home. This type of lighting can fall into other categories, too. Examples include landscape lights to illuminate trees or foliage, stairway lights, or wall sconces.




Deck Lighting
Whether it’s accent lighting or something bigger, we can wire the outdoor lighting on your deck. For example, this rooftop deck in the Lafayette Square neighborhood has accent lighting around the hand rail. The electricians of Fielder Electrical Services wired GFI outlets in addition to the strip lights.



Pergola Lighting
For this pergola in Ladue, the electricians of Fielder Electrical Services wired outdoor lighting in addition to outdoor outlets for their entertainment equipment. We have wired lighting and other electrical needs not only in pergolas, but also for gazebos and other outdoor structures.

Electrical Service Upgrades
At Fielder Electrical Services, we specialize in older and existing structures. As a result, we have ample experience wiring electrical service upgrades in homes across the St. Louis area.

It is common for older homes to have outdated systems that require electrical service upgrades to meet the current electrical codes. Our considerable experience with these types of properties is extremely beneficial for this work.

Your Electrical Service
A residential electrical service is generally comprised of two primary areas: the interior panel and the exterior meter. Just because your home might require a new interior panel does not necessarily mean you need to replace the exterior service- or visa versa.

The needs of each home are determined on a case-by-case basis with a free estimate.  Our work is done in compliance with local codes/jurisdictions and the rules set forth by the National Electric Code. Compliance requirements can also vary by municipality.

If you would like to know what is needed in order for your home to meet code requirements, contact us to request a free estimate.

Electrical Meter Replacement
The electrical meter is located on the exterior of a home. Working with the electrical panel, it is the “other half” of the electrical system.

In addition to the meter, there are other elements of the electrical system located outside the home. Any of these could need to be repaired or replaced in order to meet code requirements or the energy demands of your household. These could include:

meter base
entrance cable
riser cable
mast
weatherhead
grounding system

In addition to the meter, there are other elements of the electrical system located outside the home. Any of these could need to be repaired or replaced in order to meet code requirements or the energy demands of your household. These could include:

Electrical Repairs After Storm Damage
The St. Louis area experiences storms year round, some of which can cause storm damage to your electrical service.

Over half of the storms in our area occur between May & August. Most of the storm damage we deal with as electricians relates to the exterior meter service. Downed trees or high wind can cause damage to both home owner and utility equipment.




This illustration of a standard house can better help understand your financial responsibility if a storm causes damage to your electrical service. The items noted in GREEN are the utility’s responsibility, so they will repair/replace if damaged. The components in BLACK are the home owner’s responsibility, if damaged.

What should a home owner do after a storm?

Report any outages to Ameren UE or your utility provider right away. Same goes for a downed power line- don’t touch it!
Look for storm damage to your home, including your electrical system. This includes the interior and exterior service.
Check your fuse or breaker panel. If you see a tripped breaker, flip it all the way to the “on” position, then to the “off” position. Do this three times, to ensure the circuit is truly reset. If it will not hold in the “on” position, call us!
If you experience a complete outage, leave a light turned on, so you know right away when power is restored.
Check your outside electrical service for damage. Depending on the extent of the storm damage, you may need a Licensed Electrician to complete the repairs. (That’s us!)
Example Project: Storm Damage to Electric Service
During one of the spring & summer storms, the exterior electrical service was damaged by the heavy winds. Take a look at the work completed by our electricians and what it looked like before.


BEFORE: The mast of this St. Louis County home was damaged during a storm.

The roof mast was replaced with a new one. In addition, it was secured with two guy wires that are well-anchored. They are screwed into a stud to help support the weight of the wires.

AFTER: The mast was replaced and secured by Fielder Electrical Services.

FAQ’s (Frequently Asked Questions)
HOW DO I RESET A TRIPPED BREAKER?
iF YOU’VE LOST POWER TO A PORTION OF YOUR HOME, HEAD TO YOUR ELECTRICAL PANEL AND FIND THE BREAKER LABELED FOR THAT SPACE. IF YOUR BREAKERS AREN’T LABELED, EXAMINE THE BREAKERS, AND FIND ONE WITH A SWITCH RESTING HALFWAY BETWEEN THE ON AND OFF ZONES. ONCE LOCATED, FLIP THE BREAKER SWITCH TO THE OFF POSITION, THEN TO THE ON POSITION. FLIP THREE (3) TIMES CONSECUTIVELY (OFF, ON, OFF, ON, OFF, ON) TO MANUALLY RESET THE BREAKER. IF THIS DOESN’T SOLVE THE PROBLEM, YOU MAY HAVE A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE THAN AN OVERLOADED CIRCUIT AND SHOULD CALL AN ELECTRICIAN FOR TROUBLESHOOTING. 

WHY DO I ONLY HAVE PARTIAL POWER IN MY HOME?
IF YOU FIND THERE ARE NO TRIPPED BREAKERS OR GFCI’S, THIS MAY BE DUE TO A “LEG DOWN”, THE ELECTRICAL UTILITY COMPANY WILL TYPICALLY HAVE THREE (3) LINES COMING INTO YOUR HOME AND IF ONE OF THOE LEGS BECOMES LOOSE OR DISCONNECTED, IT CAN HAVE THE AFFECT OF PARTIAL OUTAGE IN YOUR HOME. THE UTILITY CAN COME OUT AND ASSESS THE ISSUE AND IF IT IS A PROBLEM ON THEIR END, THEY MAY TAKE CARE OF THAT WITHOUT CHARGE.

WHY HAS THIS LIGHT STOPPED WORKING?
START WITH THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION FIRST – IF THE FIXTURE IS PLUGGED INTO A RECEPTACLE, AND IT IS A GFCI OUTLET, TEST AND RESET IT. SECOND, TRY A NEW BULB IN THE LIGHT FIXTURE. EVEN NEW BULBS ARE SOMETIMES DAMAGED, SO TRY TWO. IF THAT DOESN’T WORK, ENSURE THAT THE BREAKER FOR THAT CIRCUIT IS IN THE ON POSITION. IF NONE OF THAT WORKS, YOU MAY HAVE A DEAD RECEPTACLE, BROKEN FIXTURE, OR MORE SERIOUS ELECTRICAL ISSUES AT-HAND.

HOW DO I RESET OR TEST A GFCI RECEPTACLE?
GFCI STANDS FOR GROUND FAULT CIRCUIT INTERRUPTER. THESE OUTLETS LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER OUTLETS; THERE ARE TWO SMALL BUTTONS (“TEST” AND “RESET”) ON THE FACE WHERE STANDARD OUTLETS HAVE NONE. YOU MAY NOTICE THEM ON/IN YOUR HOME IF IT WAS BUILT IN 1981 OR LATER, AND YOU WILL TYPICALLY FIND THEM IN KITCHENS, BATHROOMS, GARAGES, AND ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE – ALL AREAS WHERE WATER MAY BE PRESENT.

IF A GFCI OUTLET ISN’T WORKING, IT IS LIKELY DOING ITS JOB AND PROTECTING YOU FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCK. IN MOST INSTANCES, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIMPLY PUSH THE RESET BUTTON. IT SHOULD MAKE AN AUDIBLE ‘CLICK.’

WHEN A GFCI TRIPS, ALL OTHER GFCI OUTLETS IN THE ROOM SHOULD BE TESTED TO ENSURE THEY ARE ALL WORKING AND PROTECTING YOU FROM ELECTROCUTION.

PUSH THE TEST BUTTON.
ONCE THE RESET BUTTON POPS OUT PLUG IN A DEVICE (EX: HAIR DRYER) AND TURN IT ON.
IF THE DEVICE DOESN’T WORK WHEN THE GFCI IS IN TEST MODE, YOUR GFCI IS WORKING CORRECTLY.
IF THE DEVICE WORKS WHEN THE GFCI IS IN TEST MODE, PLEASE CALL AN ELECTRICIAN – IT IS NOT SAFE.
DO I NEED TO BE HOME DURING A SCHEDULED VISIT?
IF YOU ARE SCHEDULED FOR AN ESTIMATE, WE REQUIRE A DECISION-MAKER TO BE ON-SITE TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT SCOPE. WE CAN PERFORM MOST SCHEDULED WORK WITHOUT SOMEONE ON-SITE, AS LONG AS ENTRY IS PROVIDED WITH A CODE OR KEY IN ADVANCE. 

IS MY ELECTRICAL PANEL A FIRE HAZARD?
IF YOU HAVE A FEDERAL PACIFIC OR ZINSCO ELECTRICAL PANEL OR TRADITIONAL FUSE BOXES, YOU HAVE A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION IN YOUR HOME. PLEASE CONTACT (314) 773-4955 FOR A FREE ESTIMATE.

WHAT IS A “SHORT CIRCUIT?”
A SHORT CIRCUIT (OFTEN CALLED A “SHORT”) OCCURS WHEN THE WIRE CARRYING THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT (REFERRED TO AS THE “HOT WIRE” AND USUALLY BLACK IN COLOR) HAS CONTACT WITH THE GROUNDED CONDUCTOR (THE “NEUTRAL,” USUALLY WHITE IN COLOR) OR THE EQUIPMENT GROUND (THE “BARE COPPER,” USUALLY GREEN).

WHEN A SHORT HAPPENS, IT GENERATES AN OVERABUNDANCE OF HEAT. IF IT’S LEFT UNCHECKED, IT CAN CREATE SPARKS RESULTING IN AN ELECTRICAL FIRE. IN THE EVENT OF A SHORT, YOUR ELECTRICAL PANEL WILL CUT THE POWER TO THE CIRCUIT.

ARE A FUSE AND A CIRCUIT BREAKER DIFFERENT?
THEY PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTION BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS. BOTH FUSES AND BREAKERS END THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY TO PREVENT A PROBLEM. CIRCUIT BREAKERS CAN BE RESET EACH TIME YOU TRIP THEM, BUT FUSES MUST BE REPLACED. FOR THIS SPECIFIC REASON, CIRCUIT BREAKERS ARE MORE OFTEN USED, BUT YOU CAN STILL FIND FUSE BOXES IN MANY OLD CLEVELAND HOMES.

MY REFRIGERATOR ISN’T WORKING. I CHECKED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER, BUT IT WASN’T TRIPPED. WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?
IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER HOME (1981 OR PRIOR), CHANCES ARE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TWO CIRCUITS FOR YOUR KITCHEN WHICH GIVE POWER TO YOUR APPLIANCES. IF ONE HASN’T TRIPPED, THE OTHER MOST LIKELY HAS. BUT IF YOU’VE CHECKED BOTH OF THEM, THERE MAY BE A WIRING ISSUE, AND YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR ELECTRICIAN.

IF YOUR HOME WAS BUILT AFTER 1981, IT’S MORE LIKELY THAT ONE OF THE GFCI OUTLETS HAS TRIPPED. YOU’LL WANT TO SCAN YOUR OUTLETS FOR ANY “RESET” BUTTON THAT’S NO LONGER DEPRESSED. IF YOU DON’T HEAR A CLICK AFTER YOU PRESS IT BACK INTO PLACE AND THERE’S STILL NO POWER, THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH THE CIRCUIT WHICH A QUALIFIED ELECTRICIAN WILL NEED TO ASSESS.

WHEN I USE MY MICROWAVE, THE LIGHTS DIM, AND SOMETIMES THE BREAKER TRIPS. WHY?
IF THIS IS HAPPENING, YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR MICROWAVE MOUNTED UNDER YOUR CABINETS, ABOVE YOUR STOVE. THESE DRAW AROUND 1100-1800 WATTS DEPENDING ON THE MODEL AND FEATURES AND ARE ADDED AFTER THE HOME WAS BUILT. DURING THE BUILDING PROCESS, A RANGE HOOD IS THE ONLY THING INSTALLED THERE WHICH REQUIRES A LOWER DRAW OF ENERGY, SO A CIRCUIT WITH A LOWER WATT CAPACITY IS DESIGNATED FOR THAT AREA (USUALLY A 15 AMP CIRCUIT WHICH HAS A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE LOAD OF 1480 WATTS). THAT MEANS THE BREAKER WILL TRIP ONCE IT PASSES ABOUT 1800 WATTS.

IF YOU HAVE A MOUNTED MICROWAVE, YOU’RE ALREADY BEGINNING TO MAX OUT THE CIRCUIT. WHEN YOU HAVE THE ROOM LIGHTS ON AS WELL, YOU’RE GETTING CLOSE TO TRIPPING THE CIRCUIT BREAKER, WHICH IS WHY YOUR LIGHTS ARE DIMMING.

TO FIX THIS ISSUE, TRY ADDING A NEW 20 AMP, 120-VOLT CIRCUIT SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUR MICROWAVE. THIS WILL MEET CURRENT SAFETY CODES AND GIVE YOUR MICROWAVE SUFFICIENT POWER WITHOUT TRIPPING THE BREAKER.

IS IT NORMAL FOR MY LIGHTS TO DIM OCCASIONALLY AND THEN RETURN TO NORMAL?
YES AND NO. YOU COULD BE EXPERIENCING WHAT’S KNOWN AS A “BROWN OUT.” THESE USUALLY HAPPEN DURING THE SUMMER THANKS TO AIR CONDITIONERS CONTINUALLY RUNNING TO KEEP OUR HOMES AND WORKPLACES COMFORTABLE. ALL THE EXTRA ENERGY CONSUMPTION PUTS STRESS ON THE POWER GRIDS, AND THAT, IN TURN, CAUSES LESS ELECTRICITY TO BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR HOME. ERGO, YOUR LIGHTS DIM FOR NO SEEABLE REASON.

OR IT COULD ALSO BE A LOOSE NEUTRAL (SEE THE FIRST QUESTION) CONNECTION TO THE MAIN POWER LINE OR YOUR ELECTRICAL PANEL. YOU’LL WANT TO CALL YOUR POWER COMPANY FIRST; IF THEY DON’T SEE AN ISSUE ON THEIR END, CONTACT YOUR ELECTRICIAN.

I REPLACED MY FLUORESCENT BULBS. WHY ARE THEY STILL FLICKERING?
YOUR ISSUE COULD BE DUE TO A NUMBER OF THINGS:

ARE ALL THE PRONGS LINED UP? FLUORESCENT BULBS HAVE TWO PRONGS AT EACH END. IF THERE IS ONE THAT DOESN’T LINE UP CORRECTLY, THE BULB WILL FAIL TO LIGHT PROPERLY.

ARE YOU SURE YOU REPLACED ALL THE BULBS? SOME FIXURES WILL NOT TURN ON OR MAY FLICKER IF YOU ONLY REPLACE ONE LIGHT.

IS YOUR BALLAST BURNED OUT? THAT’S THE BLACK BOX INSIDE THE FIXTURE, WHICH IS BASICALLY A TRANSFORMER THAT CONVERTS THE 120-VOLT SUPPLY TO WHATEVER THE FLUORESCENT LIGHTS NEED. IF THIS HAS BURNED OUT, IT COULD BE THE SOURCE OF YOUR LACK OF PROPER LIGHTING.

I’VE NOTICED A DIMMER THAT FEELS WARM. IS THIS NORMAL?
GENERALLY, YES. A DIMMER IS JUST A SMALL-SCALE TRANSFORMER THAT INCREASES OR DECREASES THE VOLTAGE TO THE LIGHTS. AS IT LOWERS THE VOLTAGE, HEAT IS GENERATED AND CAN MAKE THE DIMMER PLATE WARM. THERE’S NO REASON FOR CONCERN UNLESS YOU START SMELLING BURNING PLASTIC, YOU BEGIN TO HEAR BUZZING, OR THE LIGHTS START TO FLICKER.

WHY DOESN’T A SPECIFIC OUTLET WORK?
IS IT AN OUTLET THAT’S CONTROLLED BY A SWITCH? THIS MAY SEEM OBVIOUS, BUT IF YOU’VE RECENTLY MOVED, SOMETHING LIKE A WALL SWITCH CAN BE EASILY OVERLOOKED. TRY PLUGGING SOMETHING INTO IT LIKE A FLOOR LAMP AND START TOGGLING THE WALL SWITCHES IN THE ROOM. IF THIS DOESN’T GIVE YOU A SOLUTION, CHECK TO SEE IF OTHER OUTLETS ARE OUT AS WELL. THIS COULD BE A SIGN THAT YOU HAVE A TRIPPED CIRCUIT AND THE BREAKER JUST NEEDS TO BE RESET. IF RESETTING THE BREAKER DOESN’T WORK EITHER, CONTACT (314) 773-4955 FOR A SERVICE CALL APPOINTMENT TO ASSESS THE OUTLET.
